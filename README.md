This function replicates the syntax for the built-in function 'find', but extends it to more dimensions.  
It is compatible with all releases up to and including MATLAB 6.5. For that release, the built-in find function doesn't support the find(X,K) syntax or find(X,K,side), while this function does.  
I have no access to even older releases, so I can't test compatibility, although I suspect this will work a few releases before 6.5.
